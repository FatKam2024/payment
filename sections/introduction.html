            <h2>What is a Payment?</h2>
            <p>A payment is the transfer of monetary value from one party (the payer) to another (the payee) in exchange for goods, services, or the fulfillment of an obligation. In a business context, payments are critical as they represent the final step in the sales cycle and are a direct reflection of customer trust and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Payments can take various forms, including cash transactions, digital payments, and electronic funds transfers (EFTs). In modern commerce, digital payments have become predominant, offering efficiency, security, and convenience, which are essential for scaling operations and reaching global markets.</p>

            <h2>Why Payments Matter in Business</h2>
            <p>In the business world, payments are more than just transactions—they are the lifeblood of cash flow management. Effective payment systems ensure that businesses can collect revenue promptly, manage liquidity, and invest in growth opportunities.</p>
            <p>From a customer perspective, the payment experience significantly impacts overall satisfaction and loyalty. A seamless payment process can lead to repeat business, while a cumbersome one can drive customers away. Businesses must prioritize secure, reliable, and user-friendly payment options to maintain a competitive advantage.</p>
