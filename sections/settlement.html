            <h2>Understanding Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p>Acknowledgment occurs immediately after a payment is authorized. It involves generating a confirmation for the customer, typically in the form of a receipt or order confirmation, which serves as proof of the transaction. This step is crucial for customer satisfaction and trust, ensuring that customers feel secure in their purchase.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Insight:</strong> Timely and accurate acknowledgments can enhance customer trust and reduce disputes. Automated systems that send instant confirmations via email or SMS can improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>What is Settlement?</h2>
            <p>Settlement is the process where the funds from a transaction are transferred from the customer's issuing bank to the merchant's acquiring bank. This typically occurs after the transaction has been fully authorized and the goods or services have been delivered. Settlement can take a few hours to several days, depending on the payment method and the banks involved.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Insight:</strong> Efficient settlement processes are vital for maintaining cash flow and financial stability. Understanding the settlement timelines for different payment methods can help businesses manage their finances more effectively and avoid cash flow issues.</p>
